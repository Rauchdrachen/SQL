Hello!

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. 
I have included notes in each file attempting to explain what you are looking at, or at least what I was 
attempting to accomplish.

Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions.



Thank you
